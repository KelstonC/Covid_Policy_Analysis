# Welcome

In this file you will see a short paper written in `jupyter`. This short paper is a fun excerise which looks at "what-if" scenarios for different 
COVID-19 lockdown policies, which could have been used in Ontario, Canada as well as the associated "costs" of each one. 

To simulate the various lockdown, the SIR model is used along with COVID-19 infection data from the Ontario Government.
